## Key Algorithm Features

1. **Multi-phase charging**: CC → CV → Complete with balancing throughout
2. **Predictive balancing**: Starts balancing early to prevent delays
3. **Safety-first design**: Multiple abort conditions and thermal management  
4. **Adaptive current**: Reduces charge rate during balancing for better results
5. **Duty-cycled balancing**: Prevents overheating of balance resistors
